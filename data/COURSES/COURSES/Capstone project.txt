Project Overview
Project Name: DreamLLM
Objective: Develop a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch, focusing on innovation and advanced capabilities.
Scope: The project aims to create an LLM with the ability to understand, generate, and interpret human language.
Target Audience: Researchers, developers, and enthusiasts interested in advanced AI and NLP.
Note: For the sake of time and infrastructure, the LLM will be trained on the limited data. (For the real version of it, you may want to go for huge data which will cost more.)
