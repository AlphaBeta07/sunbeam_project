The course content was well-structured and covered all the essential topics needed to build a solid foundation in Python programming. What stood out the most for me was the clarity with which the  concepts were explained. Sir went above and beyond by covering additional topics that were incredibly valuable. I now feel much more confident in my Python skills, thanks to this course.
I can genuinely say it was one of the most enriching learning experiences I’ve had. I was referred by a colleague to join SUNBEAM, I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect initially, but from the very first session, it became clear that I was in the hands of an exceptional teacher. Sir has an extraordinary talent for simplifying even the most complex Python concepts, making them easy to grasp for all students.
His explanations are consistently clear, and he demonstrates remarkable patience, ensuring that every question is answered thoroughly and that no one is left behind. What truly stood out to me was his practical approach to teaching – beyond just theory, he provided real-world examples that made it easy to see how Python could be applied in my professional work. Sir's dedication to his students is truly admirable.
I now feel confident in my Python skills and am eager to apply what I’ve learned in my career. His teaching style, depth of knowledge, and unwavering support are truly exceptional, and I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to be taught by him.
To be honest, Python was my first authentic experience of learning programming language and this
experience was made memorable by you sir. Older me was saying programming is soo boring, soo complicated, an headache. But sir you totally changed my perspective. Now, I have gained confidence
that I too can develop applications.
You just have not only taught us python, You taught insights of python. how python works internally. I never ever trained like this before. You showed the way how to look at concepts insights just not syntax. Its Conceptual + Insights + syntactical Training I got. My words are not enough to express the gratitude but still to get teacher like you needs luck also.
The quizzes at the end of each module were also a great way to test my knowledge. The Q&A sessions 15-20 mins before and after each lecture added more value to it. The example of  "Potter and Stencils" was amazing to understand the difference between "Java and Pythons class". Similarly the example of (2 or more) parallel projects while teaching the concept of working with "Virtual Environment" was amazing.
Request the sunbeam management to please start such courses for Ex-CDAC students which helps the CDAC family to grow and show what the CDAC pupils can do with CDAC gurus showing us the way ahead. It would be needless to praise our CDAC guru’s knowledge. Teaching methodologies as doing classes from US at 4:30 am PST time I always had a smile on my face a kid like zeal to learn what Sir would bring to the table that day and by end of min 2:30 hrs of a lecture he would leave us in awe. I would say CDAC sunbeam is not an institutional at all, it more of a Gurukul where the pupils are lifelong connected to the Gurus here at Sunbeam like Nilesh Sir,(for motivating when I was about to quit CDAC coming from ECE background), Prashant Sir, Vijay Sir, Sameer Sir(had a magical experience when he taught us in 2011 Feb) , Sarang Sir(never thought that Software engineering subject could be fun and also be taught)
